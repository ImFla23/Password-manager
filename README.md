# 🔑 Password Manager

I started programming in November, beginning with C++, but I wanted to challenge myself by building a complete application using only Python. While tools like Electron might be better suited for animations and graphical interfaces, I chose to push my limits and see what I could accomplish with Python alone. Any constructive feedback is highly appreciated! Let me know what you think.
